# Battle-Ship
SD247 Battle Ship Project

The Battleship project is a console-based implementation of the classic Battleship board game in C programming language. Battleship is a turn based game between two players. The two players will place their ships on a 10X10 grid and then take turns guessing where the other persons ships are. Each guess is a hit that will update and change the board as the game progresses. After each turn the user player says if the coordinate was a hit or a miss. When the ship is hit on every coordinate it is a sunk ship. When someone gets all of their ships sunk they will loose the game. In this project we were tasked with making this game with the C programming language. This game has us interacting with the program to play the game of Battleship. 

The game begins by initializing two game boards, one for the player and one for the computer. Then the ships are randomly placed on both boards. Ships of varying lengths are placed horizontally or vertically on the board without overlapping. Players then take turns guessing the coordinates of their opponent's ships, aiming to hit and sink them. The game continues until one players successfully sinks all of their opponent's ships.

In this project I was able to build the board using a two dimensional array. I also used looping and conditional statments for the ship placement. These condital statments are used to make sure there is no overlapping when placement occurs. I also used nessed loop for checking if all ships are sunk at the end of game to check for the winner. This game is an excellent way to utilize key programming features. 

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of programming, including memory allocation, randomization, conditional statements, loops, and function implementation. It showcases the use of dynamic memory allocation to create and manage the game board, as well as the implementation of logical algorithms for ship placement and hit detection. Additionally, the project highlights error handling mechanisms to prevent invalid user inputs and ensures the smooth execution of the game. Overall, the Battleship Game project provides an interactive and engaging implementation of the classic Battleship board game in a console environment, offering players a challenging and entertaining gaming experience.

To get this program to run with the best results I recommend using the latest version of VSCode. I have a gcc compiler downloaded from brew, and the code runner extension from the VSCode extension list. These were the condions that were used to build and test this program.
